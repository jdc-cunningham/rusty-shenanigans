11:16 PM

my mind man... it's everywhere right now, feeling good feeling great

11:21 PM

omg man... I keep getting distracted lmao

alright let's go...

do I have rust installed already? pretty sure I do

`let x: i32 = 42;`

signed 32 bit integer... how do you know if it's unsigned... oh `u` nice

man I studied this shit so long ago... 2's compliment and what not ahhhhhhh it's gone I'm a CRUD simpleton

oh it's split in half with negative half, unsigned is the whole thing but starting from 0

python promotes the integer on runtime as needed

lol just use `i32` for everything

i32 = long in c, int in java

rust uses i32 as default

uninitialized variables are not accessible

`_` throw away huh

`let _ = get_thing();` throw away result

tuples

fixed length collections of values of different types

explicit type annotation

`let pair: (char, i32) = ('a', 17);`

f you Jacob focus!

man this is so weird

`let (_, right) = slice.split_at(middle);` so this is like an array (no) of two things but the first one is discarded wtf

omg that's right, mutable lmao I'm committing bro, I can't just be a front end scrub forever

semicolons have to be there

vectors... `vec![...]` hmm

wth is `fold` lmao... ahh reducer equivalent hmmm

nice functions

```
fn method_name() -> i32 {
  4
}
```

arrow is return type

interesting this block scoping with brackets hmm

no global scope huh

tail of the block...

```
  let x = {
    ... crap
    tail
  }
```

I guess that's like a return with no return keybword

ahh naruhodo that's why there's no semicolon above otherwise it's `return 4;`

damn applies to if/else too

match like switch case nice

dot-style method/value calling

oh boy here we go `::` this mf

`std::cmp::min(3, 8)` crate::module::function

also `use std::cmp::min`

11:44 PM

making good progress, it's funny that's only 4.5 minutes of video lmao

hmm this is interesting  `"amos".len()` equal to `str::len("amos")`
