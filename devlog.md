back on but on main, big computer

1:03 PM

yeah I've been stuck on this trying to use chrono

made a cargo file didn't work

tried another way of importing

why does even the doc code not work lol ugh

1:08 PM

my lizard brain wants to scream, any code I try won't compile lol

code from the docs or SO

1:13 PM

holy s... okay I had to use `cargo cmd...` not the compiler

f me man

1:16 PM

omg there we go... got the release going too nice

https://stackoverflow.com/a/60947511/2710227

okay so all the stuff will work just have to use cargo to do stuff not rust compiler

ugh... lost my git history

I'm doing this on an Asus C100P Chromebook running Xenial XFCE on an SD Card on VS Code

I was able to get hello world running. VS Code file discovery is slow

I keep accidentally clicking somewhere I think because my thumb keeps grazing the touchpad

8:21 PM

geez what a waste of time using git ssh over git

I don't have a battery meter looks like

8:26 PM

alright added a battery icon to my panel

8:48 PM

I was thinking I could do the CLI thing which has API interfaces to my local RPis that hit the web eg. google spreadsheet

that would be a useful/familiar ground thing to learn Rust with

20:59 PM

I'm watching tv I will write something though, probably as I cook now, 55% charge

21:18 PM

having import issues with a crate, trying to use chrono

9:38 PM

lol I can't get past this chrono unresolved...

Please Jacob do it

hell yeah babyyyyyy hello world

I'm trying to make an "API" for like a note app, but it's just in memory

just to flex my code skills

it's like a text rpg game

11:20 PM

omg... my ADHD brain man, turn off social media

get prompt, that's what I want, then spit it back out

11:47 PM

omg I got sidetracked again damn

okay `&` is a reference there's also `*` to dereference hmm

12:12 AM

brief break

I think I can make like a CLI TODO list that would be good because I need to store shit, delete by id, etc..., make an array of strings, manipulate or an object

10:51 PM

I'm pretty spent today and spent the remainder of my mental energy watching tv... so...

I did come up with something more tangible, back to the classics, a CLI CRUD app

that'll get me to start writing rust

11:13 PM

tired af

gonna at least start the app, doesn't really count for progress

cargo mobile takes a while to install

I'm thinking about reprogramming my insect quad robot in rust, that would be a challenge

Also to actually do inverse kinematics to move the legs vs. manually-programmed gaits

11:20 PM

gotta update rust meesa got 1.64

11:24 PM

hmm don't know why I need a name unless it's that com stuff in android

also this `bevy` or `wry` what is...

bevy is game engine

whoa this egui thing is neat

wgpu graphics api

winit, window creation and management library

so I guess I have to use wry for android

11:31 PM

what is this NDK_HOME

11:37 PM

had to go into android studio

https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk

install it from sdk manager along with cmake, maybe not necessary

11:46 PM

damn another problem

11:52 PM

hmm I got it to work but turning that developer mode toggle is sus, haven't done that ever on windows

11:55 PM

so far `cargo androind open` didn't work... `cargo run` is doing something

hmm... I might just stick with tauri desktop for now and React Native

11:59 PM

wait a minute... (Independence Day chess scene)

12:01 PM

I so sorry, I will revisit another time

I'm going to make a job hunting app, has defined requirements/made some before.

Will use Rust heavily hopefully and make a desktop app to refresh skills again.

12:46 AM

ehh... I don't see a design yet in my mind

I have to sqlite too, last time I tried I failed
